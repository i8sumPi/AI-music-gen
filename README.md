# AI-music-gen
Here's my music generator. The encoding script, model, and dataset are in this repository. Then, I used python (Google Colab) to train the model because of the free GPU.

For more info, check out [n8's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIwHcSgpN7o).

# Try it
To try it, go to [the google colab code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FLmNu19Dgjz87F0KqvZPsJnl9RhKOe7Z?usp=sharing) and upload the model. As a warning, you will probably need a decent understanding to tensorflow to do this. I am working on a web player currently, which will make this process a lot easier.

If you don't want to go through that agonizing process, download some of the midi files from the results folder.
