# AI-music-gen
Here's my music generator. The encoding script, model, and dataset are in this repository. Then, I used python (Google Colab) to train the model because of the free GPU. Check out that part of the code [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FLmNu19Dgjz87F0KqvZPsJnl9RhKOe7Z?usp=sharing).

# Try it
To try it, go to [the google colab code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1FLmNu19Dgjz87F0KqvZPsJnl9RhKOe7Z?usp=sharing) and upload [the model](https://github.com/i8sumPi/AI-music-gen/tree/main/model) and [the dataset](https://github.com/i8sumPi/AI-music-gen/blob/main/as_csv.csv). As a warning, you will probably need a decent understanding to tensorflow to do this. I am working on a web player currently, which will make this process a lot easier.

If you don't want to go through that agonizing process, download some of the midi files from the results folder. They aren't cherry-picked so you'll get to see what the model is really like.
